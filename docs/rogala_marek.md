<strong>shiny.collections: Google Docs-like live collaboration in
Shiny</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
What users expect from web applications today differs dramatically from
what was available 5 years ago. They are used to interactivity, data
persistence, and what’s more, the ability to share live collaboration
experiences, like in Google Docs. If one user changes the data, other
users want to see the changes immediately on their screens. They don’t
care whether it is a data-exploration app from a data scientist or a
solution built by a team of software engineers.

Shiny is perfect for building interactive data-driven applications
suited for the modern user. In this presentation, we show how to create
real-time collaboration experience in Shiny apps.

From the presentation, you will learn the concepts of reactive
databases, how to use them in Shiny, and how to adapt existing
components to provide live collaboration.

We will present a package we developed for that. shiny.collections adds
persistent reactive collections that can be effortlessly integrated with
components like Shiny inputs, DT::dataTable or rhandsontable. The
package makes it easy to build collaborative Shiny applications with
persistent data.

The presentation will be very actionable. My goal is for everyone in the
audience to be able to add persistence and collaboration to their apps
in under 10 minutes.
