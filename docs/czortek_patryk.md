<strong>Competition and tourism drive trade-off between vegetative and
generative reproduction of rare mountain species Carex lachenalii
Schkuhr</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
A result of sexual reproduction is long-distance spread at a
meta-population level, whereas vegetative propagation contributes to
increase population growth at a local scale. Trade-offs between these
two components of reproduction reflect adaptation to the environment and
may be a suitable way to understand threats of rare key-species. Example
of such plant may be Carex lachenalii Schkuhr – a small tufted perennial
sedge, occurring in extreme-specialized snowbed and acidophilous
grasslands vegetation. This arctic-alpine species in the Tatra Mts
occurs only in a few isolated sites. In 2016 we examined 96 localities
of C. lachenalii. Maximum height and diameter, number of vegetative and
generative stems, all vascular plants within 100m2 plots and the
distance from the nearest trail was recorded for each sedge tuft, with
the aim of determining whether tourism affects trade-off. To determine
the role of competition and habitat filtering in shaping species
composition of plant communities we calculated components of functional
diversity using FD package. We used principal components analysis (PCA)
for detecting relationships between species composition and populational
traits of C. lachenalii, using vegan::envfit() function. For evaluation
the impact of vegetation traits on trade-off we used generalized
additive models (GAM) and chose the best model, based on Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC). We found habitat-dependent relationships
between all vegetation traits influencing the studied trade-off.
Distance from the nearest trail did not influence the studied traits.
